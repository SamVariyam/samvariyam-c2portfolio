    <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="first-row">
        <span class="first-one">It's hard to find words to describe our conversations.
        </span>
        <span class="first-two">I think you would just have to witness it yourself.</span>
        <span class="first-three">Would you say you're ready?</span>
        <span class="first-four">I suppose.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="second-row">
        <span class="second-one">I'm worried my friends aren't good for me.</span>
        <span class="second-two">How do you mean?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="third-row">
        <span class="third-one">Like I feel like they overwork me. Like I can't really measure up to them, so I overcompensate.</span>
        <span class="third-two">Like a sort of imposter syndrome?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="fourth-row">
        <span class="fourth-one">Wait, yeaaaa. That’s what it is! But then I’m like is this just me feeling uncomfortable with other people being better at school than I am.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="fifth-row">
        <span class="fifth-one">Not the imposter syndrome for imposter syndrome.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="sixth-row">
        <span class="sixth-one">PLEASE, no you’re so right that’s what it is. Is that weird?</span>
        <span class="sixth-two">Girl. You’re an Asian American woman in STEM at freaking Rice University. The Imposter syndrome is scientifically attached to your existence. It’s perfectly valid.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="seventh-row">
        <span class="seventh-one">Yea but... it’s still hard to accept sometimes. </span>
        <span class="seventh-two">We grew up in a place where we were just always number one at a lot of things. Of course it’s jarring to suddenly be somewhere where you’re not on top, right?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="eigth-row">
        <span class="eigth-one">That’s so true. Do you feel that way at your school though?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="ninth-row">
        <span class="ninth-one">Like YEA. Especially since now I’m supposed to be growing my creativity, which is a skill I feel like I didn’t truly explore in high school, and it feels like something you can’t really get better at.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="tenth-row">
        <span class="tenth-one">
            Oh yeaa, I never even thought about that. The validation system is so entirely different that’s crazy.</span>
        <span class="tenth-two">All of a sudden I’m emotionally attached to what I make, and if no one likes it, I’m doomed.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="eleven-row">
        <span class="eleven-one">PLEASE, and I remember in high school when like Mrs. Garrison didn’t like our work and we would feel so bad about ourselves. I can’t imagine feeling that way every time I turned something in.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="twelve-row">
        <span class="twelve-one">Yea, but also the validation from a like respected professor that’s successful in the field goes so crazy.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="thirteen-row">
        <span class="thirteen-one">
            Woahhh. Yea creative validation is probably so much more intrinsic. </span>
        <span class="thirteen-two">I mean, in a way I guess? But also it relies so much less on your own achievement. LIke you pass a physics test because <em>you</em> studied, you know?</span>
    </div>
    <div class="fourteen-row">
        <span class="fourteen-one">
            Yea but your professor likes your work just because they happen to like it.</span>
        <span class="fourteen-two">See what I mean? I don’t know, it’s not quite the same and yet it’s still good.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="fifteen-row">
        <span class="fifteen-one">
            It’s giving like the instagram update. </span>
        <span class="fifteen-two">YEA HAHA, like the Kung Fu Tea X Minions collab.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="sixteen-row">
        <span class="sixteen-one">No because what the actual hell was that.</span>
        <span class="sixteen-two">It was SO FUNNY, wierdly the correlation between minions and boba makes sense to me.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="seventeen-row">
        <span class="seventeen-one">Mmmm, something about texture probably.</span>
        <span class="seventeen-two">Ayo I don't know about you, but I'm definitely not thinking about minion textures.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="eighteen-row">
        <span class="eighteen-one">Iiiii, I’m getting soft, I’m getting squishy, perhaps tender.</span>
        <span class="eighteen-two">EWWW HAHA, like an inkling of furry.</span>
    </div>
    <div class="nineteen-row">
        <span class="nineteen-one">Remember the furries.</span>
        <span class="nineteen-two">Yea I remember the furries.</span>
    </div>
